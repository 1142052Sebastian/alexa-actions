# Alexa Actions
This repository hopes to explain the setup process of getting a custom skill integrated with the latest Alexa Media Player Home Assistant component to create actionable notifications to your Amazon Echo (or clone) devices.

# Example
You have an automation to notify you that the front door has been left unlocked for 5 mins. Instead of a simple notification, the following could take place.

Alexa: "Hi, I've noticed your front door has been left unlocked for 5 mins, would you like me to lock it?"
You: "Yes"

The front door locks.
