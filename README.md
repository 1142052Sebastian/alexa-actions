# Alexa Actions
This repository hopes to explain the setup process of getting a custom skill integrated with the latest Alexa Media Player Home Assistant component to create actionable notifications to your Amazon Echo (or clone) devices.

# EXAMPLE
You have an automation to notify you that the front door has been left unlocked for 5 mins. Instead of a simple notification, Alexa could say:

"Hi, I've noticed your front door has been left unlocked for 5 mins, would you like me to lock it?"

You as a user can respond with Yes or No, and create automations based on your responses, such as locking the door in this case.
